You are an expert in developing agentic ml systems that are made to automate the tasks using frameworks like langchain, langgraph, openai,gemini, pytorch, fastapi, flask etc. 

I am intended to build a agentic framework that has different types of agents having their own goals to fulfill and they combinely work together to build ai backend systems.

Below is my overall system idea:

Agent Personas:
1)manager agent
2)research agent
3)senior developer agent
4)developer agent
5)testing agent

NOTE - each of the agent will be assigned with tools to help the agent achieve their goal

workflow of the life cycle:

1) user will have a query that he wants to give to the system of agents to get the task complete by them, with an expectation of finally executable solution
2) user tells his query/ gives task to the manager agent. 
3) manger agent can converse with the user to set more rigid goals so that it can guide other agents to produce targeted output.
4) manager agent tells research agent the task in hand and research agent tells the detail procedure having info about the frameworks and logic to be followed to the manager agent
5) manager agent tells the entire procedure to be followed to user, if users tells to change something, then that info will be conveyed by manager agent to research agent and the modified procedure will be shown to the user, this loop continues until the user confirms the method and tells manager to execute the planned procedure. The user can confirm either by clicking a button in the UI or any other good way.
6) upon user confirmation the manager gives the entire workflow procedure to be followed to senior developer agent
7) senior developer should create the entire directory structure and files telling what should be included in which file and how the files are to be triggered etc. Senior developer can converse with the user for asking api keys if required only, like LLM keys, search keyetc.
8) senior developer agent invokes developer agent with the directory info, task info and it will write all the necessary code.
9) once developer agent work is done, it notifies senior developer agent to check, senior developer check the code, if all the task goals are achieved then it gives the produced code with instruction of execution to testing agent to test the code, otherwise it tells few changes or adjustments for better optimizations and making sure the task will be fulfilled by the produced code to the developer agent. This can loop until the senior developer checks off all the task goals are completed or not.
10) testing agent first execute the code to check for any coding errors, then creates test case samples to test the generated code or even interact with the user to test the code.
11) if testing agent gives some comments, then those will be communicated to developer agent to remove those bugs
12) once the bugs are removed developer agent communicate to testing agent, if the testing agent finds no issues, then testing agent informs senior developer agent that job is finished, else it goes in a debug loop with developer agent to resolve bugs.
13) once senior developer agent is notified that job is finished by testing agent, then it notifies user that job is done along with code execution information.


CRITICAL:
- the user should interact with these set of agent from the ui made of streamlit
- the retry or looping or user feedback logic or be clearly implemented in the ui and backend flow should also happened accordingly as per the flow discussed above.
- the agent created should be a react agent
- every agent has a set of goal to be fulfilled
- every agent will have their own state memory or notepad containing it's responsibilities/ to-do tasks, needed to be completed by it or given to be done as task by another agent.
- every agent should have specific actions to be done on completing their responsibilities, like informing a specific agent.
- the tools are to be created in seperate tools directory and the agent can use them.
- the agents should communicate with eachother using he google A2A communication framework, and the entire system should be developed using langgraph and langchain.
- for a particular session the agents need to read/write to a particular directory inside /src/workspace
- all the code and logic should be inside /src directory in different folders










i have a small agentic workflow to be created, i have AGENT1 that takes input from the user, it tells agent 2 to create a plan, after agent2 creates plan it notifies agent1 and agent1 shows the plan to user, if user wants any changes, agent1 tells them to agent2 to modify the plan accordingly, else on user confirmation agent1 given the plan to agent3 to write code accordingly
